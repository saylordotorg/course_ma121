**Unit 1: Statistics and Data** <span id="1"></span> 
*In today’s technologically advanced world, we have access to large
volumes of data. The first step of data analysis is to accurately
summarize all of this data, both graphically and numerically, so that we
can understand what the data reveals. To be able to use and interpret
the data correctly is essential to making informed decisions. For
instance, when you see a survey of opinion about a certain TV program,
you may be interested in the proportion of those people who indeed like
the program.  *  
    
 *In this unit, you will learn about descriptive statistics, which are
used to summarize and display data. After completing this unit, you will
know how to present your findings once you have collected data. For
example, suppose you want to buy a new mobile phone with a particular
type of a camera. Suppose you are not sure about the prices of any of
the phones with this feature, so you access a website that provides you
with a sample data set of prices, given your desired features. Looking
at all of the prices in a sample can sometimes be confusing. A better
way to compare this data might be to look at the median price and the
variation of prices. The median and variation are two ways out of
several ways that you can describe data. You can also graph the data so
that it is easier to see what the price distribution looks like.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will study precisely this; namely, you will learn
both numerical and graphical ways to describe and display your data. You
will understand the essentials of calculating common descriptive
statistics for measuring center, variability, and skewness in data. You
will learn to calculate and interpret these measurements and graphs.*  
    
 *Descriptive statistics are, as their name suggests,* descriptive*.
They do not generalize beyond the data considered. Descriptive
statistics illustrate what the data shows. Numerical descriptive
measures computed from data are called* statistics*. Numerical
descriptive measures of the population are called* parameters*.
Inferential statistics can be used to generalize the findings from
sample data to a broader population.*

     Instructions: Read sections 3, 5, and 6 from chapter 4.
    Also,complete the questions at the end of each section. Section 3
    introduces Pearson’s correlation and explains what the typical
    values represent. Section 5 further elaborates on the properties of
    r, particularly the fact that it is invariant under linear
    transformation. Section 6 introduces several formulas that can be
    used to compute Pearson’s correlation.  
        
     Reading these sections and answering the questions should take
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Watch this video tutorial to learn how to create the
    scatter plot for bivariate data, using two variables *x* and *y.* It
    may be useful to review the definitions on this webpage.  
        
     Watching this tutorial, pausing to take notes, and reviewing the
    definitions should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Watch the video demo, and follow the instructions to
    run the simulation. From the demonstration, you will learn how range
    restriction can affect the correlation between two variables.  
        
     Completing this interactive lab should take approximately 30
    minutes.
