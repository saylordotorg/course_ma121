**Unit 5: Hypothesis Test** <span id="5"></span> 
*A hypothesis test involves collecting and evaluating data from a
sample. The data gathered and evaluated is then used to make a decision
as to whether or not the data supports the claim that is made about the
population. This unit will teach you how to conduct hypothesis tests and
how to identify and differentiate between the errors associated with
them. *  
    
 *Many times, you need answers to questions in order to make efficient
decisions. For example, a restaurant owner might claim that his
restaurant’s food costs 30% less than other restaurants in the area, or
a phone company might claim that its phones last at least one year more
than phones from other companies. In order to decide whether it would be
more affordable to eat at the restaurant that “costs 30% less” or
another restaurant in the area, or in order to decide which phone
company to choose based on the durability of the phone, you will have to
collect data to justify these claims. The process of hypothesis testing
is a way of decision-making. In this unit, you will learn to establish
your assumptions through null and alternative hypotheses. The null
hypothesis is the hypothesis that is assumed to be true and the
hypothesis you hope to nullify, while the alternative hypothesis is the
research hypothesis that you claim to be true. This means that you need
to conduct the correct tests to be able to accept or reject the null
hypothesis. You will learn how to compare sample characteristics to see
whether there is enough data to accept or reject the null hypothesis.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 12.5 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   differentiate between type I and type II errors, and find the
    probability of these errors;  
      
-   describe and conduct hypothesis testing, calculate the p-value, and
    accept or reject the null hypothesis; and

    and population proportion, when the population standard deviation is
    unknown; perform this task; and interpret the results.
