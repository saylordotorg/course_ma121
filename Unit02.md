**Unit 2: Elements of Probability and Random Variables** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Probabilities affect our everyday lives. In this unit, you will learn
about probability and its properties, how probability behaves, and how
to calculate and use it. You will study the fundamentals of probability
and will work through examples that cover different types of probability
questions. These basic probability concepts will provide a foundation
for understanding more statistical concepts, for example, interpreting
polling results. Though you may have already encountered concepts of
probability, after this unit, you will be able to formally and precisely
predict the likelihood of an event occurring given certain
constraints.*  
    
 *Probability theory is a discipline that was created to deal with
chance phenomena. For instance, before getting a surgery, a patient
wants to know the chances that the surgery might fail; before taking
medication, you want to know the chances that there will be side
effects; before leaving your house, you want to know the chance that it
will rain today. Probability is a measure of likelihood that takes on
values between 0 and 1, inclusive, with 0 representing impossible events
and 1 representing certainty. The chances of events occurring fall
between these two values. *  
    
 *The skill of calculating probability allows us to make better
decisions. Whether you are evaluating how likely it is to get more than
50% of the questions correct on a quiz if you guess randomly; predicting
the chance that the next storm will arrive by the end of the week; or
exploring the relationship between the number of hours students spend at
the gym and their performance on an exam, an understanding of the
fundamentals of probability is crucial.*  
    
 *We will also talk about random variables. A* random
variable *describes the outcomes of a random experiment. A* statistical
distribution *describes the numbers of times each possible outcome
occurs in a sample. The values of a random variable can vary with each
repetition of an experiment. Intuitively, a random variable, summarizing
certain chance phenomenon, takes on values with certain probabilities. A
random variable can be classified as being either discrete or
continuous, depending on the values it assumes. Suppose you count the
number of people who go to a coffee shop between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. and
the amount of waiting time that they spend in that hour. In this case,
the number of people is an example of a discrete random variable and the
amount of waiting time they spend is an example of a continuous random
variable. *
