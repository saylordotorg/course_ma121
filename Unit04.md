**Unit 4: Estimation with Confidence Intervals** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn how to use the central limit theorem and
confidence intervals, the latter of which enables you to estimate
unknown population parameters. The central limit theorem provides us
with a way to make inferences from samples of non-normal populations.
This theorem states that given any population, as the sample size
increases, the sampling distribution of the means approaches a normal
distribution. This powerful theorem allows us to assume that given a
large enough sample, the sampling distribution will be normally
distributed. *  
    
 *You will also learn about confidence intervals, which provide you with
a way to estimate a population parameter. Instead of giving just a
one-number estimate of a variable, a confidence interval gives a range
of likely values for it. This is useful, because point estimates will
vary from sample to sample, so an interval with certain confidence level
is better than a single point estimate. After completing this unit, you
will know how to construct such confidence intervals and the level of
confidence.  *

     Instructions: Read sections 2 and 3 from Chapter 10. Also, complete
    the questions in each section. Section 2 explains the basic concepts
    of sample statistics and population parameters as well as the basic
    goal of estimation for which point estimates and interval estimates
    are introduced. Section 3 talks about the *degree of freedom*, which
    is defined as the number of independent pieces of information on
    which a point estimate is based. Section 3 also talks about
    *variance*, a quantity depending on the degrees of freedom.

     Instructions: Read section 4 from Chapter 10. Also, complete the
    questions at the end. Section 4 discusses two important
    characteristics used as point estimates of parameters: bias and
    sampling variability.*Bias* refers to whether an estimator tends to
    over or underestimate the parameter. *Sampling variability* refers
    to how much the estimate varies from sample to sample.  
        
     Reading this section and answering the questions should take
