Course Syllabus for "MA121: Introduction to Statistics"
-------------------------------------------------------

If you invest in financial markets, you may want to predict the price of
a stock in six months from now on the basis of company performance
measures and other economic factors. As a college student, you may be
interested in knowing the dependence of the mean starting salary of a
college graduate, based on your GPA. These are just some examples that
highlight how statistics are used in our modern society. To figure out
the desired information for each example, you need data to analyze. The
purpose of this course is to introduce you to the subject of statistics
as a science of data. There is data abound in this information age; how
to extract useful knowledge and gain a sound understanding in complex
data sets has been more of a challenge. In this course, we will focus on
the fundamentals of statistics, which may be broadly described as the
techniques to collect, clarify, summarize, organize, analyze, and
interpret numerical information. This course will begin with a brief
overview of the discipline of statistics and will then quickly focus on
descriptive statistics, introducing graphical methods of describing
data. You will learn about combinatorial probability and random
distributions, the latter of which serves as the foundation for
statistical inference.  On the side of inference, we will focus on both
estimation and hypothesis testing issues. We will also examine the
techniques to study the relationship between two or more variables; this
is known as *regression*. By the end of this course, you should gain a
sound understanding about what statistics represent, how to use
statistics to organize and display data, and how to draw valid
inferences based on data by using appropriate statistical tools. This
course has two associated options for receiving college credit. It is
designed to align with **StraighterLine's** Introduction to Statistics
examination. Visit the [StraighterLine
website](http://Straighterline.7eer.net/c/84609/110805/1322), to view
the syllabus for their MAT202 course.  For more information about this
partnership, and earning credit via StraighterLine exams, go

It also aligns with a **Thomas Edison State College** TECEP examination.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   define and apply the meaning of descriptive statistics and
    statistical inference, describe the importance of statistics, and
    interpret examples of statistics in a professional context;
-   distinguish between a population and a sample;
-   calculate and explain the purpose of measures of location,
    variability, and skewness;
-   apply simple principles of probability;
-   compute probabilities related to both discrete and continuous random
    variables;
-   identify and analyze sampling distributions for statistical
    inferences;
-   identify and analyze confidence intervals for means and proportions;
-   compare and analyze data sets using descriptive statistics,
    parameter estimation, hypothesis testing;
-   explain how the central limit theorem applies in inference, and use
    the theorem to construct confidence intervals;
-   calculate and interpret confidence intervals for one population
    average and one population proportion;
-   differentiate between type I and type II errors;
-   conduct and interpret hypothesis tests;
-   identify and evaluate relationships between two variables using
    simple linear regression; and
-   discuss concepts pertaining to linear regression, and use regression
    equations to make predictions.

### Course Information

Welcome to MA121: Introduction to Statistics. General information about
this course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer: **Ou Zhao, Ph.D. University of Michigan  
    
 **Primary Resources: **This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the following
materials:  

-   Rice University: David M. Lane et al.’s *[Online Statistics
    Education: An Interactive Multimedia Course of
    Study](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/index.html)*
-   *[Introductory
    Statistics](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Introductory%20Statistics.pdf)*
-   Missouri State University: David W. Stockburger’s *[Introductory
    Statistics: Concepts, Models, and
    Applications](http://www.psychstat.missouristate.edu/introbook/sbk00.htm)*
-   Khan Academy’s [“Statistics
    Videos”](http://www.khanacademy.org/#statistics)

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
You will also need to complete:  

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the lectures, interactive labs, reading material,
and associated questions in the course.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of **93**
**hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories, to determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For
example, unit 1 should take you 21.75 hours. Perhaps you can sit down
with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 4.75
hours) on Monday and Tuesday nights; subunit 1.2.1 (a total of 4.75
hours) on Wednesday and Thursday nights; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** It will be helpful to have a calculator for this
course. If you do not own one or have access to one, consider using this
[freeware version](http://www.calculateforfree.com/graph.html).
